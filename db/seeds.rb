# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
#
# Company.create({
#   name: "TD",
#   user_id: 1,
#   url: "tdbank.com/",
#   sign_in_url: "onlinebanking.tdbank.com/",
#   date_added: Date.today
# })
#
# CashAccount.create({
#   company_id: 1,
#   balance: 100.00,
#   apy: 0.00
# })
#
# CashAccount.first.transactions.new({
